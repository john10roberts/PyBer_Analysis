# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
To create a summary of the Ride-sharing data by city type. This summary will include a visualization to show the total fares by city type over a period of time. 

### Results
The data shows that there have been 2,375 ride shares, 2973 drivers generating $63,538.64 in fares.

The following visualization reinforces the data above showing that the total fares by city type are not close to intersecting. However, it does show that each city type experienced some increase in fares in late Feb followed by a sharp decline in fares that lasts until the start of March.

## Summary
Based on these results I would encourage some of the urban drivers, if possible, to pick up some rides in the suburban or rural areas. That should increase the average fare per driver in the urban areas while decreasing it in suburban and rural areas. I would want to see the average customer response times in conjunction with that data to ensure that we were still providing quality response times. I would also try to offer some sort of incentive for customers in the rural areas to increase the total number of rides. Again, I would also want to have an understanding on our response times with the incentives to ensure our response times remain acceptable. Lastly, I would want to know what is causing the dip after the increase in February. Understanding the reasons behind the dip might allow us to provide some sort of customer incentive across all city types to keep fares high.
